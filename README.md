This is an effort to implement all basic data structures and algorithms fundamental to computer science in the C language.

This is mainly as a learning tool - not only for myself, but for others like me - and should not be considered for production use. As such, it attempts to arrange all data structures hierarchically, reusing code where possible. For example, a stack implemented via linked lists would simply include the `slist.h` header file and use the linked list implementation contained within. Furthermore, documentation - while spartan right now - will fulfill a very important role.
