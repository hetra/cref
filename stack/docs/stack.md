# Stacks #
---

## Description ##
A stack is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure supporting two operations: push and pop. Only the top of the stack can be accessed - to access other elements in the stack (called stack frames), all elements prior to the one required must be popped off the stack. As such, stacks do not support random access.

## Operations ##
- Push
- Pop

## Edge Cases ##
- Pushing an element onto an empty stack
- Popping an element off of an empty stack
